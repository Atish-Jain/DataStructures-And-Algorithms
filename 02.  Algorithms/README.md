# **DataStructures-And-Algorithms**

## **Data Structures :-**

### **Data Structures is a way of storing/organising data in the memory, in such a way that access, management and modification become efficient.**

## **Algorithms:-**

### **Algorithms is any approach you use to perform operations on data (like searching, sorting, traversing, ..Etc.).**

## [This Folder](./) is the continuation of [01. DataStructures](../01.%20DataStructures) to proceed with Algorithm part, so the approach will be that we will follow the [guided path for DsAlgo by CN](https://www.codingninjas.com/codestudio/guided-paths/data-structures-algorithms) and in the process of solving Qs we will also buid up the concept of algorithms in proper sequence and moreover our DataStructures will also get revised because algorithm is something which we apply on data structures.
